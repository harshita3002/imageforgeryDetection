Enhancing Image Forgery Detection
        
A Comprehensive Approach using ELA, CNN, and VGG16

Overview

Our project detects image forgery using advanced techniques such as Error Level Analysis with Convolutional Neural Network (ELA-CNN) and ELA with a pre-trained VGG16 model. The combination of ELA and deep learning models improves the accuracy of forgery detection in digital content.

Features

ELA-CNN Model:

A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and forgery detection.
ELA is used to identify tampering by analysing compression level inconsistencies.
It is trained on CASIA 2.0 dataset, a widely used collection for image forensics research.

ELA + VGG16 Model:

We have integrated ELA with a pre-trained VGG16 model for improved performance.
VGG16 architecture consists of 16 weight layers that have been fine-tuned for forgery detection.
We have leveraged the ImageNet dataset for pre-training and feature extraction.
